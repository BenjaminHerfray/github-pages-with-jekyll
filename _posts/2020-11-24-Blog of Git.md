## Daily Blog Post 1

As I have said, there is absolutely nothing of interest in this blog. 
It is just me rambling on about how much I _love_ blogs. 
Did I mention to you that blogs are the **greatest thing on the Internet**? 
No? well let me tell you then why blogs are great:
1. 'Blog' is objectively the greatest word in the english language.
2. Did you know that 'blog' stands for 'boolean logarithm?' It's like a neperean logarithm but **better**!
3. With a blog, you can write anything you want. No pesky word limits to restrict your writing!
